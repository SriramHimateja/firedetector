# firedetector
<h1>Introduction</h1>

The fire detection system is a security system. The primary function of this system is to detect fires and turn on alarm to warn fire accidents. This system is written in python with OpenCV computer vision module. It is using the HSV color algorithm to detect fires.

This project provides a computer vision based technique for detecting fire and identifying hazardous fire by processing the video data generated by an ordinary camera.
